# Valkyrie

As the Valkyries' whispers guide us, we carve our path to a Valhalla of optimized Minecraft gameplay.

Valkyrie is a mod designed to optimize client-side operations while simultaneously introducing some valuable features.

Though currently in its beta stage, rest assured that Valkyrie remains fully stable. The 'beta' label simply reflects our ongoing commitment to continual improvement and optimization, we're not done enhancing its capabilities just yet!

We greatly value your feedback and ideas. If you notice anything missing or have specific optimizations in mind that you'd like us to incorporate, don't hesitate to reach out. You can share your suggestions or report issues on our GitHub page or join the conversation on our Discord server.

## Performance Enhancements

Valkyrie at its core is designed to optimize the client side to make your FPS higher and more stable, here is the list of things it optimizes:

- Faster cloud rendering
- Faster `ViewFrustum` was entirely optimized improving visual terrain loading speed and gives more stable FPS
- Faster `MathHelper`
- Faster `RenderGlobal#setupTerrain` (Only without Nothirium since it's not needed with it) [Need testing]
- Slightly faster `ModelRenderer#render`

<details>
<summary>Technical Details</summary>

- `ViewFrustum` was optimized by reducing in loop calculations, doing less work, using bitwise operations, and reducing nested loops
- `MathHelper` was optimized by using [Jafama](https://github.com/jeffhain/jafama)
- `RenderGlobal#setupTerrain` was optimized removing unnecessary duplication and merging of the chunk to update queue and optimizing the iteration process
- `RenderGlobal#getRenderChunkOffset` was optimized with bitwise operations which improve its speed, which helps with making `RenderGlobal#setupTerrain` faster
- `ModelRenderer#render` was optimized by using a rotation matrix thus reducing OpenGL calls which slightly improve performance on complex models
